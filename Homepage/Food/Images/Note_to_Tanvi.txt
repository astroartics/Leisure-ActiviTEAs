- Rename the photos as 'Img1','Img2',..... [Note that 'I' is capital]
- You will not have to change anything in the CSS file.
- The only change you will have to do is the FOR LOOP in JS file, change '19' to the total image count of Food Section.

- Delete this file if everything is working perfectly.

*IMPORTANT* - Change permission for all images to 'Read-only' or 'Read and Write' so that 'Others' can read images too, or the images may not load.
