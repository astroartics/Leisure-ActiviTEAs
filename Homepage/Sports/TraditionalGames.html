        	<h3 id="Aankh_micholi">Aankh micholi</h3>
        	<p>Aankh Micholi is a popular group outdoor game enjoyed by children aged 5 to 12. The boys and the girls actively participate in playing this group game. This game helps in developing sensory skills, alertness, and a sense of sound in the players. The denner or the blindfolded player has to make the judgment of space based on his hearing abilities. This helps the denner in developing his/her skill to be alert at all times and have a sense of sound. This game also helps in developing tactile senses.</p>
        	<h4>How to play</h4>
        	<div class="Img"><img src="TraditionalGamesImages/Eyeball.jpg"></div>
        	<p>One of the players, the denner, is blindfolded with a piece of cloth. The denner has to catch hold of one of the other players while being blindfolded. All other players scatter around in the open space and avoid the denner so that they do not get caught. The players are allowed to make sounds for the denner to give hints for the direction. The denner’s turn comes to an end as soon as he/she is able to catch one of the players. This player now becomes the denner for the next turn and the game continues till all players decide unanimously to end the game.</p>

        	<h3 id="Atya_patya">Atya-patya</h3>
        	<p>Atya patya is a traditional Indian tag sport played by two sides of nine players. It is more popular in rural areas of India. It is more commonly played in Maharashtra, a western Indian state. Atya patya is described as a "game of feints". The playing area comprises nine trenches, coming out of either side of a central trench; a point is awarded to the attacking team's players for each trench they cross without being tagged out by the defensive players within the trenches.The game ends after 4 innings (scoring turns) of 7 minutes each, with each team having two innings to score. It has been described as a game of "militant chase".The sport is played in a relatively small area and requires no equipment, similar to other games indigenous to India such as kabaddi, seven stones, kho kho, gillidanda and langdi.</p>
        	
        	<h4>Field</h4>
        	<p>The playing field is a rectangular court, with a central lane or "trench" 89 feet and 1 inch (27.15 m) long marked lengthwise down the middle of the court. Nine additional trenches, each 23 feet and 1 inch (7.03 m) long, are drawn on the court perpendicular to the central trench and 11 feet (3.4 m) away from each other, from one end of the court to the other.</p>
        	
        	<h4>How to play</h4>
        	<div class="Img"><img src="TraditionalGamesImages/Atya-Patya.jpg"></div>
        	<p>The game is played in four innings (turns), with each inning lasting for seven minutes, and the teams alternating attacking and defending roles in each inning. Before each inning, the defensive team places one player in each of the trenches. A batch of four players on the attacking team, who are referred to as "assailants", line up at one end of the court, in the area in front of the front trench. 
    The goal of the assailants is to score by crossing each trench without being eliminated; the total number of points scored in an inning by the attacking team is equal to the number of trenches crossed by their furthest-advancing assailant. If an assailant is touched by a defender (and the defender commits no faults, such as stepping out of their trench, or lifting a foot at or immediately after the time of tagging the assailant), then the assailant is "out", and must leave the court. The assailant is also out if they step out of the field while failing to keep any part of their body grounded within the field. If an assailant crosses all nine trenches, they may say the word "Tond", which compels the defenders to turn around, allowing the assailant to now attempt to re-cross the nine trenches in the opposite direction.If an assailant manages to cross all nine trenches in both directions, a "Lona" is said to have been scored, meaning that 18 points have been scored by the attacking team for the 18 times that assailant crossed a trench; after a Lona has been scored, the not-out assailants are brought back to the starting area and then allowed to continue scoring for the remainder of the inning.<br>
     Atya-patya matches are decided on a best-of-three basis.</p>
     		<h4>Defensive Faults</h4>
        	<p>
        		A defender's tag of an assailant does not count if the defender commits any of the following actions during or immediately after the tag:<br>
    			1.Raising a foot in the air.<br>
    			2.Placing any part of the body other than the feet onto the ground (known as a "hand fault").<br>
    			3.Placing a foot even partially outside of their trench (known as a "foot fault").<br>
    			4.Turning around (this occurs when the defender's shoulders face more than 90 degrees away from the front of their trench, and is known as "turning face")

        	<div class="Img"><img src="TraditionalGamesImages/Bhavra.jpg"></div>
        	<p>The game begins with all players holding their wound top. The players throw their tops at the same time – this is the "toss" for the game. The "toss" is decided by the top spun and picked up quickest. The throw is triggered by a simple countdown – at the count of 1, 2, 3 all the players wind their pambarams, unwind it on the ground to rotate and then pick it up with the rope as quickly as possible. The primary skill is to use the shortest rope length usage and still make the bambaram spin, so it can be caught with the rope. Pambarams that did not complete the toss are placed in the center of a circle. The players who finished the toss successfully try to spin the top over the tops in the circle trying to break (gunna in Karnataka slang) them and/or trying to knock them out of the circle. Each time the spinning tops have to be picked up successfully to continue</p>

        	<h3 id="Gilli_Danda">Gilli Danda</h3>
        	<p>Gilli Danda also spelled Gulli-Danda also known as Viti Dandu, Kitti-Pul and by other variations, is a sport originating from the Indian subcontinent, played in rural areas and small towns all over South Asia. The game is played with two sticks: a large one called a danda, which is used to hit a smaller one, the gilli.It bears many similarities to bat and ball games such as cricket and baseball.
Gullidanda is an ancient sport, possibly with origins over 2500 years ago.</p>
        	<h4>History</h4>
        	<p>The sport of gillidanda is derived from ghaṭikā, literally "tip-cat". Ghaṭikā is still known to countries from the Indian subcontinent and south Asian countries like Bangladesh and India. In Bangladesh, it is known as ḍāṅguli khelā; while in Nepali, it is known as Dandi-Biyo, which is a similar game.<br> The longer stick in ḍāṅguli khelā should be about 1+1⁄2 ft (0.46 m) and the shorter stick about 6 in (150 mm). There are certain rules for preparing the sticks and playing the game with them. Gillidanda traces its roots back to ancient India. The game has been played for centuries and holds cultural significance. It was not only a source of recreation but also a way to develop physical agility and coordination among players.</p>
        	<h4>How to play</h4>
        	<div class="Img"><img src="TraditionalGamesImages/Gilli_Danda.jpg"></div>
        	<p>"Gillidanda" is played with two pieces of equipment – a danda, being a long wooden stick, and a gilli, a small oval-shaped piece of wood. It is played with four or more players of even numbers. The boy on left is about to strike the gilli with the danda, while the one on right is fielding. Standing in a small circle, the player balances the gilli on a stone in an inclined manner (somewhat like a see-saw) with one end of the gilli touching the ground while the other end is in the air. The player then uses the danda to hit the gilli at the raised end, which flips it into the air. While it is in the air, the player strikes the gilli, hitting it as far as possible. Having struck the gilli, the player is required to run and touch a pre-agreed point outside the circle before the gilli is retrieved by an opponent. There are no specific dimensions of gillidanda and it does not have a limited number of players. The gilli becomes airborne after it is struck. If a fielder from the opposing team catches the gilli, the striker is out. If the gilli lands on the ground, the fielder closest to the gilli has one chance to hit the danda (which has to be placed on top of the circle used) with a throw (similar to a run out in cricket). If the fielder is successful, the striker is out; if not, the striker scores one point and gets another opportunity to strike. The team (or individual) with the most points wins the game. If the striker fails to hit the gilli in three tries, the striker is out (similar to a strikeout in baseball). After the gilli has been struck, the opposing players need to return to the circle or, in the best case, catch it in mid-air without it hitting the ground – this was believed to have later evolved into a Catch Out in cricket and baseball.</p>

        	<h3 id="Hopscotch">Tipri Paani (Hopscotch)</h3>
        	<p>Hopscotch is a popular playground game in which players toss a small object, called a lagger, into numbered triangles or a pattern of rectangles outlined on the ground and then hop or jump through the spaces and retrieve the object. It is a children's game that can be played with several players or alone. Hopscotch is a physical and cognitive workout.</p>
        	<h4>Court</h4>
        	<p>To play hopscotch, a court is first laid out on the ground. Depending on the available surface, the court is either scratched out in the dirt or drawn with chalk on pavement. Courts may be permanently marked where playgrounds are commonly paved, as in elementary schools.<br> Designs vary, but the court is usually composed of a series of linear squares interspersed with blocks of two lateral squares. Traditionally the court ends with a "safe" or "home" base in which the player may turn before completing the reverse trip. The home base may be a square, a rectangle, or a semicircle. The squares are then numbered in the sequence in which they are to be hopped.</p>
        	<h4>How to play</h4>
        	<div class="Img"><img src="TraditionalGamesImages/Hopscotch.jpg"></div>
        	<p>The first player tosses a marker onto the court. The marker (typically a small stone, coin, bean bag, or small chain with a charm) should land in the square without bouncing, sliding, or rolling out. (In Scotland and Ireland, the marker is usually replaced with an old shoe polish tin or flat stone, called a piggy.[citation needed]) In the United States the marker was called a “lagger” and in the 1940s Hopscotch Laggers made of rubber were sold by the Hoppy Taw Company of Utah. The marker must be thrown in sequential numerical order completely within the square without touching the line. The player then hops through the course, skipping the marker's square. Single squares must be hopped on one foot, except for the first single square, where either foot may be used. Side-by-side squares are straddled, with the left foot landing in the left square, and the right foot landing in the right square. Optional squares marked "Safe", "Home", or "Rest" are neutral squares, and may be hopped through in any manner without penalty. After hopping into "Safe", "Home", or "Rest", the player must then turn around and retrace their steps through the course on one or two legs, depending on the square, until reaching the marker's square. The player stops in the square before the marker and reaches down to retrieve the marker and continue the course as stated, without touching a line or stepping into a square with another player's marker. Upon successfully completing the sequence, the player continues the turn by tossing the marker into square number two, and repeating the pattern. If, while hopping through the court in either direction, the player steps on a line, misses a square, or loses balance, the turn ends. Players begin their turns where they last left off. The first player to complete one course for every numbered square on the court wins the game. Although the marker is most often picked up during the game, historically, in the boy's game, the marker was kicked sequentially back through the course on the return trip and then kicked out.</p>

        	<p>A marble is a small spherical object often made from glass, clay, steel, plastic, or agate. They vary in size, and most commonly are about 13 mm (1⁄2 in) in diameter. These toys can be used for a variety of games called marbles, as well being placed in marble runs or races, or created as a form of art.<br> They are often collected, both for nostalgia and for their aesthetic colors. Sizes may range from less than 1 mm (1⁄30 in)[citation needed] to over 8 cm (3 in), while some art glass marbles for display purposes are over 30 cm (12 in) wide. In the North of England the objects and the game are called "taws", with larger taws being called "bottle washers" after the use of a marble in Codd-neck bottles, which were often collected for play.</p>
        	<h4>How to play</h4>
        	<div class="Img"><img src="TraditionalGamesImages/Kanche.jpg"></div>
        	<p>Players from the two teams take turns to shoot at the marbles in the ring. Each shot must be taken with a knuckle touching the ring surface. The tolley is placed in the crook of the index finger and the thumb then used to flick it in the appropriate direction. Each turn starts with the tolley shot from the edge of the ring inwards. Each marble that is knocked out of the ring scores for the team concerned. If one or more marbles are knocked out of the ring and the tolley finishes within the ring, the player is entitled to another shot, the continuation shot being taken from wherever the tolley came to rest. The turn continues until a shot fails to knock a marble outside the ring or the tolley finishes outside the ring. If a shot fails to knock a marble outside the ring and the players tolley finishes inside the ring, then the tolley remains within the ring until that player's turn comes around again. This is to be avoided since it renders the tolley vulnerable to attack by the opposing team. If a tolley is knocked out of the ring by the opposing team, it is "killed". A dead tolley is not removed from the game; instead the player is handicapped thereafter by having to "knuckle down". This means each shot must be played in a more awkward position with the back of the hand touching the ground. The game ends when the last marble is knocked outside the ring. At that point the team that collected the most marbles, wins.</p>

        	<h3 id="Kho_Kho">Kho Kho</h3>
        	<p>Kho kho is a traditional Indian sport that dates back to ancient India. It is the second-most popular traditional tag game in the Indian subcontinent after kabaddi. Kho kho is played on a rectangular court with a central lane connecting two poles which are at either end of the court. During the game, nine players from the chasing team (attacking team) are on the field, with eight of them sitting (crouched) in the central lane, while three runners from the defending team run around the court and try to avoid being touched. Each sitting player on the chasing team faces the opposite half of the field that their adjacent teammates are facing. At any time, one player from the chasing team (the 'active chaser'/'attacker') may run around the court to attempt to tag (touch) members of the defending team, with one point scored per tag, and each tagged defender required to leave the field; however, the active chaser cannot cross the central lane to access the other half of the field, and cannot change direction once they start running toward either pole. The chasing team can get around these restrictions if the active chaser either switches roles with a sitting teammate (by touching them on the back while saying "Kho") who is facing the other half of the court and therefore has access to it, or runs to the area behind either pole and then switches direction/half. Each team has two turns to score and two turns to defend, with each turn lasting nine minutes. The team that scores the most points by the end of the game wins.</p>
        	<h4>Field</h4>
        	<p>The field is 27 by 16 metres (89 by 52 ft), with a distance of 24 metres (79 ft) between the two poles, and the central lane having a width of 30 centimetres (12 in). Each of the cross lanes (which pass through the sitting areas that the chasers sit in, and go from one side of the court to the other) has a width of 35 centimetres (14 in), with adjacent cross lanes 2.3 metres (7 ft 7 in) apart, and a separation of 2.55 metres (8 ft 4 in) between each pole and its adjacent cross lane. Each pole is 120 to 125 centimetres (47 to 49 in) high and 9 to 10 centimetres (3.5 to 3.9 in) in diameter. The poles are smooth and round, with no sharp edges. There are 1.5 m (4 ft 11 in)-long extensions of the court behind each of the poles known as "free zones", in which there are no restrictions on chasers' movements.</p>
        	<h4>How to play</h4>
        	<div class="Img"><img src="TraditionalGamesImages/Kho_Kho.jpg"></div>
        	<p>At the start of play, the active chaser starts off in one of the free zones, and can run into either half of the court to tag the three defenders. Once all three defenders have been tagged out or otherwise "dismissed", the next "batch" of three defenders comes onto the court. The active chaser can switch roles with a sitting teammate by touching them on the back and shouting "kho"; this is known as the active chaser "giving a kho" to the sitting teammate. One kho must be given by the active chaser upon the dismissal of a batch before the chasing team can tag any players in the next batch.For the kho to be valid, it must be given before the active chaser has gone past the cross lane that the teammate is sitting within, with the sitting teammate not moving/rising before receiving the kho. Once a sitting chaser becomes active, they may only enter the half of the court which they were facing while they were sitting; additionally, once the newly active chaser steps to the left or right of the cross lane they were sitting in (or turns in such a way that their shoulders face towards either pole), they must continue in that direction until they have reached the free zone. Also, once the newly active chaser steps out of the central lane, they cannot step back into the central lane while tagging a defender. Violating any of these rules results in a "foul", in which case the chasing team can no longer attempt to tag any defenders. In order to clear the foul, the active chaser must move in the opposite direction of the one they were running in (i.e. away from the defenders they were chasing) until they have either given a kho to a teammate, or reached the appropriate free zone. The chasing team scores points each time a defender is ruled "out" (dismissed), which happens either when a chaser tags a defender without breaking any rules, when a defender steps out of the court (with no part of the body remaining grounded within), or when a defender is late to enter the court as part of a new batch after the dismissal of the previous batch. In the case of a tie, some matches have a tiebreaker known as a "minimum chase", in which each team is allotted an additional turn to score. Each team's turn ends once they have scored one point, with the team that is faster at scoring a point during their minimum chase turn winning the match.</p>

        	<h3 id="Lagori">Lagori</h3>
        	<p>Seven stones (also known by various other names) is a traditional game from the Indian subcontinent involving a ball and a pile of flat stones, generally played between two teams in a large outdoor area. The game Seven Stones,is one of the most ancient games of the Indian subcontinent whose history dates back to the Bhagwata Purana, a Hindu religious text that is claimed to be written 5000 years ago, which mentions Lord Krishna playing the game with his friends.This traditional sport has been played for the last 5 millennia. It is believed to have been originated in the southern parts of the Indian subcontinent.</p>
        	<h4>How to play</h4>
        	<div class="Img"><img src="TraditionalGamesImages/Lagori.jpg"></div>
        	<p>A member of one team (the seekers) throws a ball at a pile of stones to knock them over. The seekers then try to restore the pile of stones while staying safe from the opposing team's (the hitter) throws. The hitters' objective is to hit the seekers with the ball before they can reconstruct the stone pile. If the ball touches a seeker, that seeker is out and the team which the seeker came from continues, without the seeker. A seeker can always safeguard themselves by touching an opposite team member before the ball hits the seeker.</p>
        	<h4>Additional rules</h4>
        	<p>1.The throwing seeker cannot come too close to the piled-up stones while attempting to knock them over. They have to do so from behind a line marked on the ground.<br>
        2.If the person trying to knock down the pile cannot do it in three tries, they are considered out.<br>
        3.If the thrower's ball does not knock down the pile and is caught by an opponent four times after the first bounce then the thrower is out.<br>
        4.Each team contains an equal number of players.<br>
        5.Piles of flat stones contain 7 or 10 stones.<br>
        6.Hitters cannot run with the ball to hit the seekers.<br>
        7.The seeker, after restoring the pile of stones, says the game's name to announce the reconstruction of the pile of stones.<br>
        8.If the ball is thrown by the thrower and hits the piles and the opposite member catch the ball then the whole gis out.</p>

        	<p>Langdi is a traditional Indian field sport which combines elements of tag and hopscotch.It was originally played during the Pandiyan Dynasty and called "Nondiyaattam" at that time. The teams alternate chasing (attacking) and defending roles in each of the 4 innings of the game, with the chasing team's players restricted to hopping around on one foot, and attempting to score points by tagging as many defenders as possible within the 9 minutes of each inning. It is described by Marathis as a sport with a Marathi ethos. Langdi is considered to be useful in training for sports like kho kho, volleyball and gymnastics. The National Langdi Federation received national recognition in 2010. Langdi in Maharashtra is a popular childhood pastime, it is described as the foundation of all sports.</p>

        	<div class="Img"><img src="TraditionalGamesImages/Langdi.jpg"></div>
        	<p>The rules of this sport have been standardised by the Akhil Maharashtra Sharirik Shikshan Mandal.The field is a maximum size of 18 metres (59 ft) by 18 metres (59 ft), with the main playing area being a square of about 10 metres (33 ft) on each side. Langdi is a team sport between two sides, played 12 players a side, and an additional three extra players. A match lasts 36 minutes. It is played in four innings of nine minutes each, with the teams alternating roles in each inning. A coin toss is done before the game, with the team that wins the toss defending. The chasing team sends chasers who hop on one foot and try to tag the defenders. The chasers can step out of the ground as long as they keep on one foot. The defenders are declared out if they step out of the ground or commit a line fault. Once all defenders in the field are tagged, a new set of defenders enter the field from a designated entry zone, with the chaser required to go to the other half of the field before tagging the new defenders. If the chaser fails to remain on one foot, then they leave the field and are replaced by a teammate. During the first turn that a team chases, their chasers must hop on their right foot, and then in their next chasing turn they must all hop on their left foot. The team that tags the most defenders is declared the winner.</p>
        	
        	
        	
        	
        	
        	
        	
        	
        	
        	
        	
        	<h3 id="Mallakhamb">Mallakhamb</h3>
        	<p>Mallakhamba, or mallakhamb is a traditional sport, originating from the Indian subcontinent, in which a group of gymnasts perform aerial yoga and gymnastic postures using wrestling grips in concert with a stationary vertical pole. The word "mallakhamb" also refers to the pole used in the sport. The pole is usually made from sheesham (Indian rosewood) polished with castor oil.Other popular versions of mallakhamba are practiced using a cane or a rope instead of a pole.The origins of pole dancing can be traced back to the sport of mallakhamba. The name mallakhamba derives from the terms malla, meaning wrestler, and khamb, which means a pole. Literally meaning "wrestling pole", the term refers to a traditional training implement used by wrestlers. On April 9, 2013, the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh declared mallakhamba the state sport. As of 2017, more than 20 other states in India have followed suit.</p>
        	<h4>How to play</h4>
        	<div class="Img"><img src="TraditionalGamesImages/Mallakhamb.jpg"></div>
        	<p>The rules of mallakhamb are fairly simple and close to gymnastics and are as follows:<br>
        1.Participants need to perform acrobatic feats with a vertical pole or rope as the prop and judges score them according to their mastery over the skills.<br>
    2.Competitors are mainly judged on five different categories – mounting (where performers jump on and run on the pole), acrobatics (where performers execute acrobatic flips, turns and twists on the pole), catches (where performers catch the pole after being airborne), balances (where performers showcase their balance on the pole) and dismounts (where performers jump off gracefully from the top of the pole).<br>
    3.Judges score each competitor during a performance and the one with the highest score is declared the winner.</p>
    		<h4>Types</h4>
        	<p>1.Pole mallakhamb is essentially the traditional form of mallakhamb. Competitors perform on a wooden pole which is 2.6m in height and has a circumference of 55cm at the base. 
        The pole gradually tapers to a circumference of 35cm at the top.<br>
        2.Hanging mallakhamb, meanwhile, uses a shorter pole suspended with hooks or chains as the prop. The bottom of the pole in hanging mallakhamb doesn’t touch the ground.<br>
        3.Rope mallakhamb is performed on a suspended rope which is 5.5m long and 2cm in diameter.</p>
