<h1>How to play</h1>
<p>
    One of the players, the denner, is blindfolded with a piece of cloth. The denner has to catch hold of one of the other players while being blindfolded. 
    All other players scatter around in the open space and avoid the denner so that they do not get caught.
    The players are allowed to make sounds for the denner to give hints for the direction. The dennerâ€™s turn comes to an end as soon as he/she is able to catch one of the players. 
    This player now becomes the denner for the next turn and the game continues till all players decide unanimously to end the game.
