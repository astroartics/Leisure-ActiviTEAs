<h1><u>Atya Patya</u></h1>

<p>
    Atya patya is a traditional Indian tag sport played by two sides of nine players. It is more popular in rural areas of India. It is more commonly played in Maharashtra, a western Indian state. Atya patya is described as a "game of feints". The playing area comprises nine trenches, coming out of either side of a central trench; a point is awarded to the attacking team's players for each trench they cross without being tagged out by the defensive players within the trenches.The game ends after 4 innings (scoring turns) of 7 minutes each, with each team having two innings to score. It has been described as a game of "militant chase".The sport is played in a relatively small area and requires no equipment, similar to other games indigenous to India such as kabaddi, seven stones, kho kho, gillidanda and langdi.

<h1>Rules for playing game</h1>
<h2>Field:</h2>
<p>
    The playing field is a rectangular court, with a central lane or "trench" 89 feet and 1 inch (27.15 m) long marked lengthwise down the middle of the court. Nine additional trenches, each 23 feet and 1 inch (7.03 m) long, are drawn on the court perpendicular to the central trench and 11 feet (3.4 m) away from each other, from one end of the court to the other.
</p>
<h2>GamePlay:</h2>
<p>
    The game is played in four innings (turns), with each inning lasting for seven minutes, and the teams alternating attacking and defending roles in each inning. Before each inning, the defensive team places one player in each of the trenches. A batch of four players on the attacking team, who are referred to as "assailants", line up at one end of the court, in the area in front of the front trench. 
    The goal of the assailants is to score by crossing each trench without being eliminated; the total number of points scored in an inning by the attacking team is equal to the number of trenches crossed by their furthest-advancing assailant. If an assailant is touched by a defender (and the defender commits no faults, such as stepping out of their trench, or lifting a foot at or immediately after the time of tagging the assailant), then the assailant is "out", and must leave the court.
    The assailant is also out if they step out of the field while failing to keep any part of their body grounded within the field.<br>
    If an assailant crosses all nine trenches, they may say the word "Tond", which compels the defenders to turn around, allowing the assailant to now attempt to re-cross the nine trenches in the opposite direction.If an assailant manages to cross all nine trenches in both directions, a "Lona" is said to have been scored, meaning that 18 points have been scored by the attacking team for the 18 times that assailant crossed a trench; after a Lona has been scored, the not-out assailants are brought back to the starting area and then allowed to continue scoring for the remainder of the inning.<br>
     Atya-patya matches are decided on a best-of-three basis.
</p>
<h3>List of Defensive Faults:</h3>
<p>
    A defender's tag of an assailant does not count if the defender commits any of the following actions during or immediately after the tag:<br>
    1.Raising a foot in the air.<br>
    2.Placing any part of the body other than the feet onto the ground (known as a "hand fault").<br>
    3.Placing a foot even partially outside of their trench (known as a "foot fault").<br>
    4.Turning around (this occurs when the defender's shoulders face more than 90 degrees away from the front of their trench, and is known as "turning face")
</p>
<h3>Grenadier or sur</h3>
<p>
    The defender in the front trench is known as a "grenadier" or "sur", and is able to run in either the front trench or the central trench. 
    Grenadiers are allowed to commit any fault other than a foot fault or hand fault where part of their body goes outside of their trench.<br>
    At the start of the inning, or after a Lona has been scored, the grenadier must "cut the squares" before tagging any assailants, 
    meaning that the grenadier must run from the square which is formed by the intersection of the front trench and the central trench to the square formed by the intersection of the next trench and the central trench, and then back to the first square.
</p>

<h3>Rings</h3>
<p>
    Special rules apply when two or more assailants are encircled by a regular defender and a grenadier, which is known as a "ring".
