    Gilli Danda also spelled Gulli-Danda also known as Viti Dandu, Kitti-Pul and by other variations, is a sport originating from the Indian subcontinent, played in rural areas and small towns all over South Asia. The game is played with two sticks: a large one called a danda, which is used to hit a smaller one, the gilli.It bears many similarities to bat and ball games such as cricket and baseball.
    Gullidanda is an ancient sport, possibly with origins over 2500 years ago.

<h1>History</h1>
    <p>The sport of gillidanda is derived from ghaṭikā, literally "tip-cat". Ghaṭikā is still known to countries from the Indian subcontinent and south Asian countries like Bangladesh and India. In Bangladesh, it is known as ḍāṅguli khelā; while in Nepali, it is known as Dandi-Biyo, which is a similar game.<br> The longer stick in ḍāṅguli khelā should be about 1+1⁄2 ft (0.46 m) and the shorter stick about 6 in (150 mm). 
        There are certain rules for preparing the sticks and playing the game with them. Gillidanda traces its roots back to ancient India. The game has been played for centuries and holds cultural significance. It was not only a source of recreation but also a way to develop physical agility and coordination among players.

<h1>Rules for playing Game</h1>
    <p>
        "Gillidanda" is played with two pieces of equipment – a danda, being a long wooden stick, and a gilli, a small oval-shaped piece of wood. It is played with four or more players of even numbers.<br>
        The boy on left is about to strike the gilli with the danda, while the one on right is fielding.<br>
        Standing in a small circle, the player balances the gilli on a stone in an inclined manner (somewhat like a see-saw) with one end of the gilli touching the ground while the other end is in the air. The player then uses the danda to hit the gilli at the raised end, which flips it into the air. While it is in the air, the player strikes the gilli, hitting it as far as possible.<br> 
        Having struck the gilli, the player is required to run and touch a pre-agreed point outside the circle before the gilli is retrieved by an opponent. There are no specific dimensions of gillidanda and it does not have a limited number of players.<br>
        The gilli becomes airborne after it is struck. If a fielder from the opposing team catches the gilli, the striker is out. If the gilli lands on the ground, the fielder closest to the gilli has one chance to hit the danda (which has to be placed on top of the circle used) with a throw (similar to a run out in cricket). If the fielder is successful, the striker is out; if not, the striker scores one point and gets another opportunity to strike. <br>
        The team (or individual) with the most points wins the game. If the striker fails to hit the gilli in three tries, the striker is out (similar to a strikeout in baseball). After the gilli has been struck, the opposing players need to return to the circle or, in the best case, catch it in mid-air without it hitting the ground – this was believed to have later evolved into a Catch Out in cricket and baseball.
