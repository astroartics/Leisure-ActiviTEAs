        Mallakhamba, or mallakhamb is a traditional sport, originating from the Indian subcontinent, in which a group of gymnasts perform aerial yoga and gymnastic postures using wrestling grips in concert with a stationary vertical pole. The word "mallakhamb" also refers to the pole used in the sport. The pole is usually made from sheesham (Indian rosewood) polished with castor oil.Other popular versions of mallakhamba are practiced using a cane or a rope instead of a pole.The origins of pole dancing can be traced back to the sport of mallakhamba. The name mallakhamba derives from the terms malla, meaning wrestler, and khamb, which means a pole. Literally meaning "wrestling pole", the term refers to a traditional training implement used by wrestlers. On April 9, 2013, the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh declared mallakhamba the state sport. As of 2017, more than 20 other states in India have followed suit.

    <h1>Rules for playing game</h1>
    <p>
        The rules of mallakhamb are fairly simple and close to gymnastics and are as follows:<br>
        1.Participants need to perform acrobatic feats with a vertical pole or rope as the prop and judges score them according to their mastery over the skills.<br>
    2.Competitors are mainly judged on five different categories – mounting (where performers jump on and run on the pole), acrobatics (where performers execute acrobatic flips, turns and twists on the pole), catches (where performers catch the pole after being airborne),
     balances (where performers showcase their balance on the pole) and dismounts (where performers jump off gracefully from the top of the pole).<br>
    3.Judges score each competitor during a performance and the one with the highest score is declared the winner.

    <h1>Types of Mallakhamb</h1>
    <p>
        Over the years, three types of mallakhamb variations have gained popularity in competitions. They are pole mallakhamb, hanging mallakhamb and rope mallakhamb.<br>
        1.Pole mallakhamb is essentially the traditional form of mallakhamb. Competitors perform on a wooden pole which is 2.6m in height and has a circumference of 55cm at the base. 
        The pole gradually tapers to a circumference of 35cm at the top.<br><br>
        2.Hanging mallakhamb, meanwhile, uses a shorter pole suspended with hooks or chains as the prop. The bottom of the pole in hanging mallakhamb doesn’t touch the ground.<br><br>
        3.Rope mallakhamb is performed on a suspended rope which is 5.5m long and 2cm in diameter.
