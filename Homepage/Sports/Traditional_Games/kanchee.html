            A marble is a small spherical object often made from glass, clay, steel, plastic, or agate. They vary in size, and most commonly are about 13 mm (1⁄2 in) in diameter. These toys can be used for a variety of games called marbles, as well being placed in marble runs or races, or created as a form of art.<br> They are often collected, both for nostalgia and for their aesthetic colors. Sizes may range from less than 1 mm (1⁄30 in)[citation needed] to over 8 cm (3 in), while some art glass marbles for display purposes are over 30 cm (12 in) wide. In the North of England the objects and the game are called "taws", with larger taws being called "bottle washers" after the use of a marble in Codd-neck bottles, which were often collected for play.

    <h1>Rules for playing game</h1>
        <p>
            Players from the two teams take turns to shoot at the marbles in the ring. Each shot must be taken with a knuckle touching the ring surface. The tolley is placed in the crook of the index finger and the thumb then used to flick it in the appropriate direction. Each turn starts with the tolley shot from the edge of the ring inwards. Each marble that is knocked out of the ring scores for the team concerned. If one or more marbles are knocked out of the ring and the tolley finishes within the ring, the player is entitled to another shot, the continuation shot being taken from wherever the tolley came to rest. The turn continues until a shot fails to knock a marble outside the ring or the tolley finishes outside the ring. If a shot fails to knock a marble outside the ring and the players tolley finishes inside the ring, then the tolley remains within the ring until that player's turn comes around again. This is to be avoided since it renders the tolley vulnerable to attack by the opposing team. If a tolley is knocked out of the ring by the opposing team, it is "killed". A dead tolley is not removed from the game; instead the player is handicapped thereafter by having to "knuckle down". This means each shot must be played in a more awkward position with the back of the hand touching the ground. The game ends when the last marble is knocked outside the ring. At that point the team that collected the most marbles, wins.

            Main article: Marbles (game)<br>
            Various games can be played with marbles.<br>
            One game popular in the United Kingdom and United States is ring taw (or "ringer"), where a ring is drawn on the ground and a number of small marbles placed within it. Players take turns to flick a larger "taw" marble at these marbles, attempting to knock them out of the ring.

    <h1>Competitions</h1>
        <p>
            The British and World Marbles Championship has been held at Tinsley Green, West Sussex, England, every year since 1932.<br> (Marbles has been played in Tinsley Green and the surrounding area for many centuries:TIME magazine traces its origins to 1588.) Traditionally, the marbles-playing season started on Ash Wednesday and lasted until midday on Good Friday: playing after that was thought to bring bad luck. More than 20 teams from around the world take part in the championship, each Good Friday; German teams have been successful several times since 2000, although local teams from Crawley, Copthorne and other Sussex and Surrey villages often take part as well; the first championship in 1932 was won by Ellen Geary, a young girl from London.
